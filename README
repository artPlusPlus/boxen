boxen
=====

boxen is a persistence system for JSON data.

JSON data is managed by a Container. A Container is represented as a file on disk. Containers have a capacity on the number of objects they will manage.

Containers are managed by a Depot. A Depot defines the capacity of all Containers it manages. It also provides a simple caching system for commonly request JSON objects.
